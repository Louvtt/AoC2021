# AoC2021

My answer for the [Aoc Website](adventofcode.com/2021) problems.

## CPP

For cpp answer: 
- Create a subfolder (like 'build') of the folder the day is in.
- Go to the subfolder `cd yourFolderName`
- Launch cmake (<1.9.1 required): `cmake ../ -G yourGenerator`
(I tested with the "MinGW Makefiles" generator)
- Build using your generator (if mingw: `mingw32-make`)
- Run the .exe

## JS

Just open the index.html in a browser.

## Licence

Do whatever you want, if you want to optimize or just copy the 'dtp' (which is the template i made for aoc in js) to try solve yourself the problems.
Have fun !
